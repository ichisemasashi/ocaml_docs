It also defines the basic idioms for error handling and serialization, and contains well organized APIs for every basic data type from integers to lazy values. This is comes along with a minimum of external dependencies, so **Base** just takes seconds to build and install. It’s also portable, running on every platform that OCaml does, including Windows and JavaScript. -->\n",
    "-  **Base**は標準ライブラリから必要とされる基本を提供するように設計されています。ハッシュテーブル、セット、シーケンスなど、基本的で効率的なさまざまなデータ構造があります。また、エラー処理とシリアル化のための基本的なイディオムも定義しており、整数から遅延値までのすべての基本的なデータ型のためのよく整理されたAPIを含みます。これは最小限の外部の依存関係と一緒に来るので、**Base**は構築とインストールに数秒かかるだけです。 WindowsやJavaScriptを含め、OCamlが行うすべてのプラットフォーム上で動作し、移植性もあります。\n",

    "<!-- - **Core_kernel** extends **Base** with many new data structures, like heaps, and other capabilities, like types to represent times and time-zones, and support for efficient binary serializers.

    "-  **Core_kernel**はヒープのような多くの新しいデータ構造や時間やタイムゾーンを表す型のような他の機能、そして効率的なバイナリシリアライザのサポートで**Base**を拡張します。まだ移植性はありますが、依存関係が多くなり、構築に時間がかかり、実行可能ファイルのサイズが大きくなります。\n",

The types have different literals (**6.** instead of **6**) and different infix operators (**+.** instead of **+**), and OCaml doesn’t automatically cast between these types. This can be a bit of a nuisance, but it has its benefits, since it prevents some kinds of bugs that arise in other languages due to unexpected differences between the behavior of **int** and **float**. For example, in many languages, **1 / 3** is zero, but **1 / 3.0** is a third. OCaml requires you to be explicit about which operation you’re using. -->\n",
    "-  OCamlは**float**（浮動小数点数のための型）と**int**（整数のための型）を慎重に区別する。型は異なるリテラル（**6**の代わりに**6.**）と異なる中置演算子（**+**の代わりに**+.**）を持ち、OCamlはこれらの型の間で自動的にキャストしません。これは少し面倒かもしれませんが、**int**と**float**の動作の予期しない違いによって他の言語で発生するある種のバグを防ぐので、それには利点があります。たとえば、多くの言語で、**1/3**はゼロですが、**1 / 3.0**は3分の1です。 OCamlはあなたがどの操作を使用しているかについてあなたが明白になることを要求します。\n",

    "\n",
    "1. OCaml requires that both branches of an **if** statement have the same type, so the expression\n",
    "\n",
    "    **if test first then first else 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "    requires that **first** must be the same type as **0**, and so **first** must be of type **int**. Similarly, from\n",
    "\n",
    "    **if test second then second else 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "    we can infer that **second** has type **int**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **test** is passed **first** as an argument. Since **first** has type **int**, the input type of **test** must be **int**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **test first** is used as the condition in an **if** statement, so the return type of **test** must be **bool**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The fact that **+** returns **int** implies that the return value of **sum_if_true** must be **int**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, that nails down the types of all the variables, which determines the overall type of **sum_if_true**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, you’ll build a rough intuition for how the OCaml inference engine works, which makes it easier to reason through your programs. You can also make it easier to understand the types of a given expression by adding explicit type annotations. These annotations don’t change the behavior of an OCaml program, but they can serve as useful documentation, as well as catch unintended type changes. They can also be helpful in figuring out why a given piece of code fails to compile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an annotated version of **sum_if_true**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let sum_if_true (test : int -> bool) (x : int) (y : int) : int =\n",
    "  (if test x then x else 0)\n",
    "  + (if test y then y else 0)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val sum_if_true : (int -> bool) -> int -> int -> int = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, we’ve marked every argument to the function with its type, with the final annotation indicating the type of the return value. Such type annotations can be placed on any expression in an OCaml program:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inferring Generic Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, there isn’t enough information to fully determine the concrete type of a given value. Consider this function..\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let first_if_true test x y =\n",
    "  if test x then x else y\n",

    "**first_if_true** takes as its arguments a function **test**, and two values, **x** and **y**, where **x** is to be returned if **test x** evaluates to **true**, and **y** otherwise. So what’s the type of the **x** argument to **first_if_true**? There are no obvious clues such as arithmetic operators or literals to narrow it down. That makes it seem like **first_if_true** would work on values of any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, if we look at the type returned by the toplevel, we see that rather than choose a single concrete type, OCaml has introduced a type variable'**a** to express that the type is generic. (You can tell it’s a type variable by the leading single quote mark.) In particular, the type of the **test** argument is (**'a -> bool**), which means that **test** is a one-argument function whose return value is **bool** and whose argument could be of any type **'a**. But, whatever type **'a** is, it has to be the same as the type of the other two arguments, **x** and **y**, and of the return value of **first_if_true**. This kind of genericity is called parametric polymorphism because it works by parameterizing the type in question with a type variable. It is very similar to generics in C# and Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the type of **first_if_true** is generic, we can write this:\n",

We’ll start by looking at a particularly simple data structure, the tuple. A tuple is an ordered collection of values that can each be of a different type. You can create a tuple by joining values together with a comma.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Base** comes with a **List** module that has a rich collection of functions for working with lists. We can access values from within a module by using dot notation. For example, this is how we compute the length of a list:\n",
    "\n",

    "List.length languages;;\n",
    "- : int = 3\n",
    "```\n",

    "List.map languages ~f:String.length;;\n",
    "- : int list = [5; 4; 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**List.map** takes two arguments: a list and a function for transforming the elements of that list. It returns a new list with the transformed elements and does not modify the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, the function passed to **List.map** is passed under a labeled *argument* **~f**. Labeled arguments are specified by name rather than by position, and thus allow you to change the order in which arguments are presented to a function without changing its behavior, as you can see here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "List.map ~f:String.length languages;;\n",
    "- : int list = [5; 4; 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll learn more about labeled arguments and why they’re important in Chapter 2, Variables And Functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CONSTRUCTING LISTS WITH ::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to constructing lists using brackets, we can use the list constructor **::** for adding elements to the front of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "\"French\" :: \"Spanish\" :: languages;;\n",
    "- : string list = [\"French\"; \"Spanish\"; \"OCaml\"; \"Perl\"; \"C\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we’re creating a new and extended list, not changing the list we started with, as you can see below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "languages;;\n",
    "- : string list = [\"OCaml\"; \"Perl\"; \"C\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### SEMICOLONS VERSUS COMMAS\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many other languages, OCaml uses semicolons to separate list elements in lists rather than commas. Commas, instead, are used for separating elements in a tuple. If you try to use commas in a list, you’ll see that your code compiles but doesn’t do quite what you might expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "[\"OCaml\", \"Perl\", \"C\"];;\n",
    "- : (string * string * string) list = [(\"OCaml\", \"Perl\", \"C\")]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, rather than a list of three strings, what we have is a singleton list containing a three-tuple of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uncovers the fact that commas create a tuple, even if there are no surrounding parens. So, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "1,2,3;;\n",
    "- : int * int * int = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to allocate a tuple of integers. This is generally considered poor style and should be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bracket notation for lists is really just syntactic sugar for **::**. Thus, the following declarations are all equivalent. Note that **\\[\\]** is used to represent the empty list and that **::** is right-associative:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "[1; 2; 3];;\n",
    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3]\n",
    "1 :: (2 :: (3 :: []));;\n",
    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3]\n",
    "1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;\n",
    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **::** constructor can only be used for adding one element to the front of the list, with the list terminating at **\\[\\]** , the empty list. There’s also a list concatenation operator, **@**, which can concatenate two lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "[1;2;3] @ [4;5;6];;\n",
    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]\n",

    "\n",
    "### LIST PATTERNS USING MATCH\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of a list can be accessed through pattern matching. List patterns are based on the two list constructors, **\\[\\]** and **::**. Here’s a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let my_favorite_language (my_favorite :: the_rest) =\n",
    "  my_favorite\n",
    ";;\n",
    "Characters 25-68:\n",
    "Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.\n",
    "Here is an example of a case that is not matched:\n",
    "[]\n",
    "val my_favorite_language : 'a list -> 'a =\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By pattern matching using **::**, we’ve isolated and named the first element of the list (**my_favorite**) and the remainder of the list (**the_rest**). If you know Lisp or Scheme, what we’ve done is the equivalent of using the functions **car** and **cdr** to isolate the first element of a list and the remainder of that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, however, the toplevel did not like this definition and spit out a warning indicating that the pattern is not exhaustive. This means that there are values of the type in question that won’t be captured by the pattern. The warning even gives an example of a value that doesn’t match the provided pattern, in particular, **\\[\\]**, the empty list. If we try to run **my_favorite_language**, we’ll see that it works on nonempty lists and fails on empty ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "my_favorite_language [\"English\";\"Spanish\";\"French\"];;\n",
    "- : string = \"English\"\n",
    "my_favorite_language [];;\n",
    "Exception: Match_failure (\"//toplevel//\", 1, 26).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can avoid these warnings, and more importantly make sure that your code actually handles all of the possible cases, by using a **match** statement instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **match** statement is a kind of juiced-up version of the **switch** statement found in C and Java. It essentially lets you list a sequence of patterns, separated by pipe characters. (The one before the first case is optional.) The compiler then dispatches to the code following the first matching pattern. As we’ve already seen, the pattern can mint new variables that correspond to parts of the value being matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a new version of **my_favorite_language** that uses **match** and doesn’t trigger a compiler warning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let my_favorite_language languages =\n",
    "  match languages with\n",
    "  | first :: the_rest -> first\n",
    "  | [] -> \"OCaml\" (* A good default! *)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val my_favorite_language : string list -> string = \n",
    "my_favorite_language [\"English\";\"Spanish\";\"French\"];;\n",
    "- : string = \"English\"\n",
    "my_favorite_language [];;\n",
    "- : string = \"OCaml\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding code also includes our first comment. OCaml comments are bounded by **(\\*** and **\\*)** and can be nested arbitrarily and cover multiple lines. There’s no equivalent of C++-style single-line comments that are prefixed by //.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first pattern, **first :: the_rest**, covers the case where **languages** has at least one element, since every list except for the empty list can be written down with one or more ::’s. The second pattern, **\\[\\]**, matches only the empty list. These cases are exhaustive, since every list is either empty or has at least one element, a fact that is verified by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RECURSIVE LIST FUNCTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions, or functions that call themselves, are an important part of working in OCaml or really any functional language. The typical approach to designing a recursive function is to separate the logic into a set of base cases that can be solved directly and a set of inductive cases, where the function breaks the problem down into smaller pieces and then calls itself to solve those smaller problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing recursive list functions, this separation between the base cases and the inductive cases is often done using pattern matching. Here’s a simple example of a function that sums the elements of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let rec sum l =\n",
    "  match l with\n",
    "  | [] -> 0                   (* base case *)\n",
    "  | hd :: tl -> hd + sum tl   (* inductive case *)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val sum : int list -> int = \n",
    "sum [1;2;3];;\n",
    "- : int = 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the common OCaml idiom, we use **hd** to refer to the head of the list and **tl** to refer to the tail. Note that we had to use the **rec** keyword to allow **sum** to refer to itself. As you might imagine, the base case and inductive case are different arms of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically, you can think of the evaluation of a simple recursive function like **sum** almost as if it were a mathematical equation whose meaning you were unfolding step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "sum [1;2;3]\n",
    "= 1 + sum [2;3]\n",
    "= 1 + (2 + sum [3])\n",
    "= 1 + (2 + (3 + sum []))\n",
    "= 1 + (2 + (3 + 0))\n",
    "= 1 + (2 + 3)\n",
    "= 1 + 5\n",
    "= 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests a reasonable mental model for what OCaml is actually doing to evaluate a recursive function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can introduce more complicated list patterns as well. Here’s a function for removing sequential duplicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =\n",
    "  match list with\n",
    "  | [] -> []\n",
    "  | first :: second :: tl ->\n",
    "    if first = second then remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl)\n",
    "    else first :: remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "Characters 48-246:\n",
    "Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.\n",
    "Here is an example of a case that is not matched:\n",
    "_::[]\n",
    "val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list =\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the first arm of the match is the base case, and the second is the inductive case. Unfortunately, this code has a problem, as indicated by the warning message. In particular, it doesn’t handle one-element lists. We can fix this warning by adding another case to the match:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =\n",
    "  match list with\n",
    "  | [] -> []\n",
    "  | [hd] -> [hd]\n",
    "  | hd1 :: hd2 :: tl ->\n",

    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this code used another variant of the list pattern, **\\[hd\\]**, to match a list with a single element. We can do this to match a list with any fixed number of elements; for example, **\\[x;y;z\\]** will match any list with exactly three elements and will bind those elements to the variables **x**, **y**, and **z**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last few examples, our list processing code involved a lot of recursive functions. In practice, this isn’t usually necessary. Most of the time, you’ll find yourself happy to use the iteration functions found in the **List** module. But it’s good to know how to use recursion for when you need to iterate in a new way. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common data structure in OCaml is the option. An option is used to express that a value might or might not be present. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let divide x y =\n",
    "if y = 0 then None else Some (x / y)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val divide : int -> int -> int option = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function **divide** either returns **None** if the divisor is zero, or **Some** of the result of the division otherwise. **Some** and **None** are constructors that let you build optional values, just as **::** and **\\[\\]** let you build lists. You can think of an option as a specialized list that can only have zero or one elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the contents of an option, we use pattern matching, as we did with tuples and lists. Let’s see how this plays out in a small example. We’ll write a function that takes a filename, and returns a version of that filename with the file extension (the part after the dot) downcased. We’ll base this on the function **String.rsplit2** to split the string based on the rightmost period found in the string. Note that **String.rsplit2** has return type **(string \\* string) option**, returning **None** when no character was found to split on.\n",

    "This kind of nested **let** binding is a common way of building up a complex expression, with each **let** naming some component, before combining them in one final expression.\n",

In such languages, null is lurking everywhere.\n",

    "In OCaml, however, missing values are explicit. A value of type **string \\* string** always contains two well-defined values of type **string**. If you want to allow, say, the first of those to be absent, then you need to change the type to **string option \\* string**. As we’ll see in Chapter 7, Error Handling, this explicitness allows the compiler to provide a great deal of help in making sure you’re correctly handling the possibility of missing data.\n",

    "# Imperative Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The code we’ve written so far has been almost entirely pure or functional, which roughly speaking means that the code in question doesn’t modify variables or values as part of its execution. Indeed, almost all of the data structures we’ve encountered are immutable, meaning there’s no way in the language to modify them at all. This is a quite different style from imperative programming, where computations are structured as sequences of instructions that operate by making modifications to the state of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional code is the default in OCaml, with variable bindings and most data structures being immutable. But OCaml also has excellent support for imperative programming, including mutable data structures like arrays and hash tables, and control-flow constructs like **for** and **while** loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest mutable data structure in OCaml is the array. Arrays in OCaml are very similar to arrays in other languages like C: indexing starts at 0, and accessing or modifying an array element is a constant-time operation. Arrays are more compact in terms of memory utilization than most other data structures in OCaml, including lists. Here’s an example:\n",
    "\n",

    "- : int array = [|1; 2; 4; 4|]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The .(i) syntax is used to refer to an element of an array, and the **<-** syntax is for modification. Because the elements of the array are counted starting at zero, element .(2) is the third element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **unit** type that we see in the preceding code is interesting in that it has only one possible value, written (). This means that a value of type **unit** doesn’t convey any information, and so is generally used as a placeholder. Thus, we use **unit** for the return value of an operation like setting a mutable field that communicates by side effect rather than by returning a value. It’s also used as the argument to functions that don’t require an input value. This is similar to the role that **void** plays in languages like C and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutable Record Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The array is an important mutable data structure, but it’s not the only one. Records, which are immutable by default, can have some of their fields explicitly declared as mutable.

    "## Refs\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",

    "The **'a** before the **ref** indicates that the **ref** type is polymorphic, in the same way that lists are polymorphic, meaning it can contain values of any type. The parentheses around ! and := are needed because these are operators, rather than ordinary functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though a **ref** is just another record type, it’s important because it is the standard way of simulating the traditional mutable variables you’ll find in most languages. For example, we can sum over the elements of a list imperatively by calling **List.iter** to call a simple function on every element of a list, using a **ref** to accumulate the results:\n",
