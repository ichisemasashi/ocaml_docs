    "This chapter gives an overview of OCaml by walking through a series of small examples that cover most of the major features of the language. This should provide a sense of what OCaml can do, without getting too deep into any one topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the book we’re going to use **Base**, a more full-featured and capable replacement for OCaml’s standard library. We’ll also use **utop**, a shell that lets you type in expressions and evaluate them interactively. **utop** is an easier-to-use version of OCaml’s standard toplevel (which you can start by typing ocaml at the command line). These instructions will assume you’re using **utop**, but the ordinary toplevel should mostly work fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## Base, Core and Core_kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base** is one of a family of three standard library replacements, each with different use-cases, each building on the last. Here’s a quick summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base** is designed to provide the fundamentals needed from a standard library. It has a variety of basic efficient data structures like hash-tables, sets and sequences. It also defines the basic idioms for error handling and serialization, and contains well organized APIs for every basic data type from integers to lazy values. This is comes along with a minimum of external dependencies, so **Base** just takes seconds to build and install. It’s also portable, running on every platform that OCaml does, including Windows and JavaScript.\n",
    "- **Core_kernel** extends **Base** with many new data structures, like heaps, and other capabilities, like types to represent times and time-zones, and support for efficient binary serializers. It’s still portable, but has many more dependencies, takes longer to build, and will add more to the size of your executables.\n",
    "- **Core** is the most full-featured, extending **Core_kernel** with support for a variety of UNIX APIs, but only works on UNIX-like OSs, including Linux and macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **Base** in this section, but you should check out **Core** and **Core_kernel**, depending on your requirements. We’ll discuss some of the additional functionality provided by Core and Core_kernel later in the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started, make sure you have a working OCaml installation so you can try out the examples as you read through the chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# OCaml as a Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to open **Base**:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "open Base;;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By opening **Base**, we make the definitions it contains available without having to reference **Base** explicitly. This is required for many of the examples in the tour and in the remainder of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s try a few simple numerical calculations:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "3 + 4;;\n",
    "- : int = 7\n",
    "8 / 3;;\n",
    "- : int = 2\n",
    "3.5 +. 6.;;\n",
    "- : float = 9.5\n",
    "30_000_000 / 300_000;;\n",
    "- : int = 100\n",
    "3 * 5 > 14;;\n",
    "- : bool = true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By and large, this is pretty similar to what you’d find in any programming language, but a few things jump right out at you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We needed to type **;;** in order to tell the toplevel that it should evaluate an expression. This is a peculiarity of the toplevel that is not required in standalone programs (though it is sometimes helpful to include **;;** to improve OCaml’s error reporting, by making it more explicit where a given top-level declaration was intended to end).\n",
    "- After evaluating an expression, the toplevel first prints the type of the result, and then prints the result itself.\n",
    "- Function arguments are separated by spaces instead of by parentheses and commas, which is more like the UNIX shell than it is like traditional programming languages such as C or Java.\n",
    "- OCaml allows you to place underscores in the middle of numeric literals to improve readability. Note that underscores can be placed anywhere within a number, not just every three digits.\n",
    "- OCaml carefully distinguishes between **float**, the type for floating-point numbers, and **int**, the type for integers. The types have different literals (**6.** instead of **6**) and different infix operators (**+.** instead of **+**), and OCaml doesn’t automatically cast between these types. This can be a bit of a nuisance, but it has its benefits, since it prevents some kinds of bugs that arise in other languages due to unexpected differences between the behavior of **int** and **float**. For example, in many languages, **1 / 3** is zero, but **1 / 3.0** is a third. OCaml requires you to be explicit about which operation you’re using.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create a variable to name the value of a given expression, using the let keyword. This is known as a let binding:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let x = 3 + 4;;\n",
    "val x : int = 7\n",
    "let y = x + x;;\n",
    "val y : int = 14\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After a new variable is created, the toplevel tells us the name of the variable (**x** or **y**), in addition to its type (**int**) and value (**7** or **14**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are some constraints on what identifiers can be used for variable names. Punctuation is excluded, except for _ and ', and variables must start with a lowercase letter or an underscore. Thus, these are legal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let x7 = 3 + 4;;\n",
    "val x7 : int = 7\n",
    "let x_plus_y = x + y;;\n",
    "val x_plus_y : int = 21\n",
    "let x' = x + 1;;\n",
    "val x' : int = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples, however, are not legal:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let Seven = 3 + 4;;\n",
    "Characters 4-9:\n",
    "Error: Unbound constructor Seven\n",
    "let 7x = 7;;\n",
    "Characters 4-6:\n",
    "Error: Unknown modifier 'x' for literal 7x\n",
    "let x-plus-y = x + y;;\n",
    "Characters 6-10:\n",
    "Error: Syntax error\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights that variables can’t be capitalized, can’t begin with numbers, and can’t contain dashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions and Type Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "The **let** syntax can also be used to define a function:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let square x = x * x;;\n",
    "val square : int -> int = \n",
    "square 2;;\n",
    "- : int = 4\n",
    "square (square 2);;\n",
    "- : int = 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in OCaml are values like any other, which is why we use the **let** keyword to bind a function to a variable name, just as we use **let** to bind a simple value like an integer to a variable name. When using **let** to define a function, the first identifier after the **let** is the function name, and each subsequent identifier is a different argument to the function. Thus, **square** is a function with a single argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’re creating more interesting values like functions, the types have gotten more interesting too. **int -> int** is a function type, in this case indicating a function that takes an int and returns an int. We can also write functions that take multiple arguments. (Reminder: Don’t forget **open Base**, or these examples won’t work!)  \n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let ratio x y =\n",
    "  Float.of_int x /. Float.of_int y\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val ratio : int -> int -> float = \n",
    "ratio 4 7;;\n",
    "- : float = 0.571428571428571397\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding example also happens to be our first use of modules. Here, **Float.of_int** refers to the **of_int** function contained in the **Float** module. This is different from what you might expect from an object-oriented language, where dot-notation is typically used for accessing a method of an object. Note that module names always start with a capital letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can also be opened to make their contents available without explicitly qualifying by the module name. We did that once already, when we opened **Base** earlier. We can use that to make this code a little easier to read, both avoiding the repetition of **Float** above, and avoiding use of the slightly awkward **/.** operator. In the following example, we open the **Float.O** module, which has a bunch of useful operators and functions that are designed to be used in this kind of context. Note that this causes the standard int-only arithmetic operators to be shadowed locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let ratio x y =\n",
    "  let open Float.O in\n",
    "  of_int x / of_int y\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val ratio : int -> int -> float = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we used a slightly different syntax for opening the module, since we were only opening it in the local scope inside the definition of **ratio**. There’s also a more concise syntax for local opens, as you can see here.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let ratio x y =\n",
    "  Float.O.(of_int x / of_int y)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val ratio : int -> int -> float = \n",
    "```\n",
    "The notation for the type-signature of a multiargument function may be a little surprising at first, but we’ll explain where it comes from when we get to function currying in Chapter 2, Multi Argument Functions. For the moment, think of the arrows as separating different arguments of the function, with the type after the final arrow being the return value. Thus, **int -> int -> float** describes a function that takes two **int** arguments and returns a **float**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write functions that take other functions as arguments. Here’s an example of a function that takes three arguments: a test function and two integer arguments. The function returns the sum of the integers that pass the test:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let sum_if_true test first second =\n",
    "  (if test first then first else 0)\n",
    "  + (if test second then second else 0)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val sum_if_true : (int -> bool) -> int -> int -> int = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the inferred type signature in detail, we see that the first argument is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean, and that the remaining two arguments are integers. Here’s an example of this function in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let even x =\n",
    "x % 2 = 0\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val even : int -> bool = \n",
    "sum_if_true even 3 4;;\n",
    "- : int = 4\n",
    "sum_if_true even 2 4;;\n",
    "- : int = 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the definition of **even**, we used **=** in two different ways: once as part of the **let** binding that separates the thing being defined from its definition; and once as an equality test, when comparing **x % 2** to **0**. These are very different operations despite the fact that they share some syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "As the types we encounter get more complicated, you might ask yourself how OCaml is able to figure them out, given that we didn’t write down any explicit type information. \n",
    "\n",
    "OCaml determines the type of an expression using a technique called type inference, by which the type of an expression is inferred from the available type information about the components of that expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let’s walk through the process of inferring the type of **sum_if_true**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OCaml requires that both branches of an **if** statement have the same type, so the expression\n",
    "\n",
    "    **if test first then first else 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "    requires that **first** must be the same type as **0**, and so **first** must be of type **int**. Similarly, from\n",
    "\n",
    "    **if test second then second else 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "    we can infer that **second** has type **int**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **test** is passed **first** as an argument. Since **first** has type **int**, the input type of **test** must be **int**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **test first** is used as the condition in an **if** statement, so the return type of **test** must be **bool**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The fact that **+** returns **int** implies that the return value of **sum_if_true** must be **int**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, that nails down the types of all the variables, which determines the overall type of **sum_if_true**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, you’ll build a rough intuition for how the OCaml inference engine works, which makes it easier to reason through your programs. You can also make it easier to understand the types of a given expression by adding explicit type annotations. These annotations don’t change the behavior of an OCaml program, but they can serve as useful documentation, as well as catch unintended type changes. They can also be helpful in figuring out why a given piece of code fails to compile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an annotated version of **sum_if_true**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let sum_if_true (test : int -> bool) (x : int) (y : int) : int =\n",
    "  (if test x then x else 0)\n",
    "  + (if test y then y else 0)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val sum_if_true : (int -> bool) -> int -> int -> int = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, we’ve marked every argument to the function with its type, with the final annotation indicating the type of the return value. Such type annotations can be placed on any expression in an OCaml program:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inferring Generic Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, there isn’t enough information to fully determine the concrete type of a given value. Consider this function..\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let first_if_true test x y =\n",
    "  if test x then x else y\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val first_if_true : ('a -> bool) -> 'a -> 'a -> 'a =\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**first_if_true** takes as its arguments a function **test**, and two values, **x** and **y**, where **x** is to be returned if **test x** evaluates to **true**, and **y** otherwise. So what’s the type of the **x** argument to **first_if_true**? There are no obvious clues such as arithmetic operators or literals to narrow it down. That makes it seem like **first_if_true** would work on values of any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, if we look at the type returned by the toplevel, we see that rather than choose a single concrete type, OCaml has introduced a type variable'**a** to express that the type is generic. (You can tell it’s a type variable by the leading single quote mark.) In particular, the type of the **test** argument is (**'a -> bool**), which means that **test** is a one-argument function whose return value is **bool** and whose argument could be of any type **'a**. But, whatever type **'a** is, it has to be the same as the type of the other two arguments, **x** and **y**, and of the return value of **first_if_true**. This kind of genericity is called parametric polymorphism because it works by parameterizing the type in question with a type variable. It is very similar to generics in C# and Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the type of **first_if_true** is generic, we can write this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let long_string s = String.length s > 6;;\n",
    "val long_string : string -> bool = \n",
    "first_if_true long_string \"short\" \"loooooong\";;\n",
    "- : string = \"loooooong\"\n",

    "val big_number : int -> bool = \n",
    "first_if_true big_number 4 3;;\n",
    "- : int = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both **long_string** and **big_number** are functions, and each is passed to **first_if_true** with two other arguments of the appropriate type (strings in the first example, and integers in the second). But we can’t mix and match two different concrete types for **'a** in the same use of **first_if_true**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "first_if_true big_number \"short\" \"loooooong\";;\n",
    "Characters 25-32:\n",
    "Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of type\n",
    "         int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, **big_number** requires that **'a** be instantiated as **int**, whereas **\"short\"** and **\"loooooong\"** require that **'a** be instantiated as **string**, and they can’t both be right at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "### TYPE ERRORS VERSUS EXCEPTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a big difference in OCaml (and really in any compiled language) between errors that are caught at compile time and those that are caught at runtime. It’s better to catch errors as early as possible in the development process, and compilation time is best of all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in the toplevel somewhat obscures the difference between runtime and compile-time errors, but that difference is still there. Generally, type errors like this one:\n",

    "Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of type\n",
    "         int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "are compile-time errors (because **+** requires that both its arguments be of type **int**), whereas errors that can’t be caught by the type system, like division by zero, lead to runtime exceptions:\n",

    "Invalid_argument \"8 % 0 in core_int.ml: modulus should be positive\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction here is that type errors will stop you whether or not the offending code is ever actually executed. Merely defining **add_potato** is an error, whereas **is_a_multiple** only fails when it’s called, and then, only when it’s called with an input that triggers the exception.\n",

    "# Tuples, Lists, Options, and Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we’ve encountered a handful of basic types like **int**, **float**, and **string**, as well as function types like **string -> int**. But we haven’t yet talked about any data structures. We’ll start by looking at a particularly simple data structure, the tuple. A tuple is an ordered collection of values that can each be of a different type. You can create a tuple by joining values together with a comma.\n",

    "**List.map** takes two arguments: a list and a function for transforming the elements of that list. It returns a new list with the transformed elements and does not modify the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, the function passed to **List.map** is passed under a labeled *argument* **~f**. Labeled arguments are specified by name rather than by position, and thus allow you to change the order in which arguments are presented to a function without changing its behavior, as you can see here:\n",

    "#### SEMICOLONS VERSUS COMMAS\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many other languages, OCaml uses semicolons to separate list elements in lists rather than commas. Commas, instead, are used for separating elements in a tuple. If you try to use commas in a list, you’ll see that your code compiles but doesn’t do quite what you might expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "[\"OCaml\", \"Perl\", \"C\"];;\n",
    "- : (string * string * string) list = [(\"OCaml\", \"Perl\", \"C\")]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, rather than a list of three strings, what we have is a singleton list containing a three-tuple of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uncovers the fact that commas create a tuple, even if there are no surrounding parens. So, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "1,2,3;;\n",
    "- : int * int * int = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to allocate a tuple of integers. This is generally considered poor style and should be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bracket notation for lists is really just syntactic sugar for **::**. Thus, the following declarations are all equivalent. Note that **\\[\\]** is used to represent the empty list and that **::** is right-associative:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "[1; 2; 3];;\n",
    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3]\n",
    "1 :: (2 :: (3 :: []));;\n",
    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3]\n",
    "1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;\n",
    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **::** constructor can only be used for adding one element to the front of the list, with the list terminating at **\\[\\]** , the empty list. There’s also a list concatenation operator, **@**, which can concatenate two lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "[1;2;3] @ [4;5;6];;\n",
    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to remember that, unlike **::**, this is not a constant-time operation. Concatenating two lists takes time proportional to the length of the first list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LIST PATTERNS USING MATCH\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of a list can be accessed through pattern matching. List patterns are based on the two list constructors, **\\[\\]** and **::**. Here’s a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let my_favorite_language (my_favorite :: the_rest) =\n",
    "  my_favorite\n",
    ";;\n",
    "Characters 25-68:\n",
    "Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.\n",
    "Here is an example of a case that is not matched:\n",
    "[]\n",
    "val my_favorite_language : 'a list -> 'a =\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By pattern matching using **::**, we’ve isolated and named the first element of the list (**my_favorite**) and the remainder of the list (**the_rest**). If you know Lisp or Scheme, what we’ve done is the equivalent of using the functions **car** and **cdr** to isolate the first element of a list and the remainder of that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, however, the toplevel did not like this definition and spit out a warning indicating that the pattern is not exhaustive. This means that there are values of the type in question that won’t be captured by the pattern. The warning even gives an example of a value that doesn’t match the provided pattern, in particular, **\\[\\]**, the empty list. If we try to run **my_favorite_language**, we’ll see that it works on nonempty lists and fails on empty ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "my_favorite_language [\"English\";\"Spanish\";\"French\"];;\n",
    "- : string = \"English\"\n",
    "my_favorite_language [];;\n",
    "Exception: Match_failure (\"//toplevel//\", 1, 26).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can avoid these warnings, and more importantly make sure that your code actually handles all of the possible cases, by using a **match** statement instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **match** statement is a kind of juiced-up version of the **switch** statement found in C and Java. It essentially lets you list a sequence of patterns, separated by pipe characters. (The one before the first case is optional.) The compiler then dispatches to the code following the first matching pattern. As we’ve already seen, the pattern can mint new variables that correspond to parts of the value being matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a new version of **my_favorite_language** that uses **match** and doesn’t trigger a compiler warning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let my_favorite_language languages =\n",
    "  match languages with\n",
    "  | first :: the_rest -> first\n",
    "  | [] -> \"OCaml\" (* A good default! *)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val my_favorite_language : string list -> string = \n",
    "my_favorite_language [\"English\";\"Spanish\";\"French\"];;\n",
    "- : string = \"English\"\n",
    "my_favorite_language [];;\n",
    "- : string = \"OCaml\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding code also includes our first comment. OCaml comments are bounded by **(\\*** and **\\*)** and can be nested arbitrarily and cover multiple lines. There’s no equivalent of C++-style single-line comments that are prefixed by //.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first pattern, **first :: the_rest**, covers the case where **languages** has at least one element, since every list except for the empty list can be written down with one or more ::’s. The second pattern, **\\[\\]**, matches only the empty list. These cases are exhaustive, since every list is either empty or has at least one element, a fact that is verified by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RECURSIVE LIST FUNCTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions, or functions that call themselves, are an important part of working in OCaml or really any functional language. The typical approach to designing a recursive function is to separate the logic into a set of base cases that can be solved directly and a set of inductive cases, where the function breaks the problem down into smaller pieces and then calls itself to solve those smaller problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing recursive list functions, this separation between the base cases and the inductive cases is often done using pattern matching. Here’s a simple example of a function that sums the elements of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let rec sum l =\n",
    "  match l with\n",
    "  | [] -> 0                   (* base case *)\n",
    "  | hd :: tl -> hd + sum tl   (* inductive case *)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val sum : int list -> int = \n",
    "sum [1;2;3];;\n",
    "- : int = 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the common OCaml idiom, we use **hd** to refer to the head of the list and **tl** to refer to the tail. Note that we had to use the **rec** keyword to allow **sum** to refer to itself. As you might imagine, the base case and inductive case are different arms of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically, you can think of the evaluation of a simple recursive function like **sum** almost as if it were a mathematical equation whose meaning you were unfolding step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "sum [1;2;3]\n",
    "= 1 + sum [2;3]\n",
    "= 1 + (2 + sum [3])\n",
    "= 1 + (2 + (3 + sum []))\n",
    "= 1 + (2 + (3 + 0))\n",
    "= 1 + (2 + 3)\n",
    "= 1 + 5\n",
    "= 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests a reasonable mental model for what OCaml is actually doing to evaluate a recursive function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can introduce more complicated list patterns as well. Here’s a function for removing sequential duplicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =\n",
    "  match list with\n",
    "  | [] -> []\n",
    "  | first :: second :: tl ->\n",
    "    if first = second then remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl)\n",
    "    else first :: remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "Characters 48-246:\n",
    "Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.\n",
    "Here is an example of a case that is not matched:\n",
    "_::[]\n",
    "val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list =\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the first arm of the match is the base case, and the second is the inductive case. Unfortunately, this code has a problem, as indicated by the warning message. In particular, it doesn’t handle one-element lists. We can fix this warning by adding another case to the match:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =\n",
    "  match list with\n",
    "  | [] -> []\n",
    "  | [hd] -> [hd]\n",
    "  | hd1 :: hd2 :: tl ->\n",
    "    if hd1 = hd2 then remove_sequential_duplicates (hd2 :: tl)\n",
    "    else hd1 :: remove_sequential_duplicates (hd2 :: tl)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = \n",
    "remove_sequential_duplicates [1;1;2;3;3;4;4;1;1;1];;\n",
    "- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this code used another variant of the list pattern, **\\[hd\\]**, to match a list with a single element. We can do this to match a list with any fixed number of elements; for example, **\\[x;y;z\\]** will match any list with exactly three elements and will bind those elements to the variables **x**, **y**, and **z**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last few examples, our list processing code involved a lot of recursive functions. In practice, this isn’t usually necessary. Most of the time, you’ll find yourself happy to use the iteration functions found in the **List** module. But it’s good to know how to use recursion for when you need to iterate in a new way. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common data structure in OCaml is the option. An option is used to express that a value might or might not be present. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let divide x y =\n",
    "if y = 0 then None else Some (x / y)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val divide : int -> int -> int option = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function **divide** either returns **None** if the divisor is zero, or **Some** of the result of the division otherwise. **Some** and **None** are constructors that let you build optional values, just as **::** and **\\[\\]** let you build lists. You can think of an option as a specialized list that can only have zero or one elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the contents of an option, we use pattern matching, as we did with tuples and lists. Let’s see how this plays out in a small example. We’ll write a function that takes a filename, and returns a version of that filename with the file extension (the part after the dot) downcased. We’ll base this on the function **String.rsplit2** to split the string based on the rightmost period found in the string. Note that **String.rsplit2** has return type **(string \\* string) option**, returning **None** when no character was found to split on.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let downcase_extension filename =\n",
    "  match String.rsplit2 filename ~on:'.' with\n",
    "  | None -> filename\n",
    "  | Some (base,ext) ->\n",
    "    base ^ \".\" ^ String.lowercase ext\n",

    ";;\n",
    "- : string list = [\"Hello_World.txt\"; \"Hello_World.txt\"; \"Hello_World\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we used the **^** operator for concatenating strings. The concatenation operator is provided as part of the **Pervasives** module, which is automatically opened in every OCaml program.\n",

    "### NESTING LETS WITH LET AND IN\n",
    "\n",
    "**log_entry** was our first use of **let** to define a new variable within the body of a function. **A let** paired with an **in** can be used to introduce a new binding within any local scope, including a function body. The **in** marks the beginning of the scope within which the new variable can be used. Thus, we could write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let x = 7 in\n",
    "x + x\n",
    ";;\n",
    "- : int = 14\n",

    "x;;\n",
    "Characters 0-1:\n",
    "Error: Unbound value x\n",
    "```\n",

    "This kind of nested **let** binding is a common way of building up a complex expression, with each **let** naming some component, before combining them in one final expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options are important because they are the standard way in OCaml to encode a value that might not be there; there’s no such thing as a **NullPointerException** in OCaml. This is different from most other languages, including Java and C#, where most if not all data types are nullable, meaning that, whatever their type is, any given value also contains the possibility of being a null value. In such languages, null is lurking everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OCaml, however, missing values are explicit. A value of type **string \\* string** always contains two well-defined values of type **string**. If you want to allow, say, the first of those to be absent, then you need to change the type to **string option \\* string**. As we’ll see in Chapter 7, Error Handling, this explicitness allows the compiler to provide a great deal of help in making sure you’re correctly handling the possibility of missing data.\n",
