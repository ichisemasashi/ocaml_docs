    "Variables and functions are fundamental ideas that show up in virtually all programming languages. OCaml has a different take on these concepts than most languages you’re likely to have encountered, so this chapter will cover OCaml’s approach to variables and functions in some detail, starting with the basics of how to define a variable, and ending with the intricacies of functions with labeled and optional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t be discouraged if you find yourself overwhelmed by some of the details, especially toward the end of the chapter. The concepts here are important, but if they don’t connect for you on your first read, you should return to this chapter after you’ve gotten a better sense of the rest of the language.\n",

    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "At its simplest, a variable is an identifier whose meaning is bound to a particular value. In OCaml these bindings are often introduced using the **let** keyword. We can type a so-called top-level **let** binding with the following syntax. Note that variable names must start with a lowercase letter or an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let <variable> = <expr>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’ll see when we get to the module system in Chapter 4, Files Modules And Programs, this same syntax is used for **let** bindings at the top level of a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every variable binding has a scope, which is the portion of the code that can refer to that binding. When using **utop**, the scope of a top-level **let** binding is everything that follows it in the session. When it shows up in a module, the scope is the remainder of that module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "open Base;;\n",
    "let x = 3;;\n",
    "val x : int = 3\n",
    "let y = 4;;\n",
    "val y : int = 4\n",
    "let z = x + y;;\n",
    "val z : int = 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**let** can also be used to create a variable binding whose scope is limited to a particular expression, using the following syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let <variable> = <expr1> in <expr2>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This first evaluates **expr1** and then evaluates **expr2** with **variable** bound to whatever value was produced by the evaluation of **expr1**. Here’s how it looks in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let languages = \"OCaml,Perl,C++,C\";;\n",
    "val languages : string = \"OCaml,Perl,C++,C\"\n",
    "let dashed_languages =\n",
    "  let language_list = String.split languages ~on:',' in\n",
    "  String.concat ~sep:\"-\" language_list\n",

    "val dashed_languages : string = \"OCaml-Perl-C++-C\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the scope of **language_list** is just the expression **String.concat ~sep:\"-\" language_list** and is not available at the toplevel, as we can see if we try to access it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "language_list;;\n",
    "Characters 0-13:\n",
    "Error: Unbound value language_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **let** binding in an inner scope can shadow, or hide, the definition from an outer scope. So, for example, we could have written the **dashed_languages** example as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let languages = \"OCaml,Perl,C++,C\";;\n",
    "val languages : string = \"OCaml,Perl,C++,C\"\n",

    "val dashed_languages : string = \"OCaml-Perl-C++-C\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, in the inner scope we called the list of strings **languages** instead of **language_list**, thus hiding the original definition of **languages**. But once the definition of **dashed_languages** is complete, the inner scope has closed and the original definition of languages is still available.\n",

    "One common idiom is to use a series of nested **let**/**in** expressions to build up the components of a larger computation. Thus, we might write. \n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let area_of_ring inner_radius outer_radius =\n",
    "  let pi = Float.pi in\n",

    "- : float = 25.132741228718345\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important not to confuse a sequence of **let** bindings with the modification of a mutable variable. For example, consider how **area_of_ring** would work if we had instead written this purposefully confusing bit of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let area_of_ring inner_radius outer_radius =\n",
    "  let pi = Float.pi in\n",
    "  let area_of_circle r = pi *. r *. r in\n",
    "  let pi = 0. in\n",
    "  area_of_circle outer_radius -. area_of_circle inner_radius\n",
    ";;\n",
    "Characters 121-123:\n",
    "Warning 26: unused variable pi.\n",
    "val area_of_ring : float -> float -> float = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we redefined **pi** to be zero after the definition of **area_of_circle**. You might think that this would mean that the result of the computation would now be zero, but in fact, the behavior of the function is unchanged. That’s because the original definition of **pi** wasn’t changed; it was just shadowed, which means that any subsequent reference to **pi** would see the new definition of **pi** as 0, but earlier references would still see the old one. But there is no later use of **pi**, so the binding of **pi** to 0. made no difference at all. This explains the warning produced by the toplevel telling us that there is an unused variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OCaml, **let** bindings are immutable. There are many kinds of mutable values in OCaml, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 8, Imperative Programming, but there are no mutable variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "## Why Don’t Variables Vary?\n",
    "\n",
    "One source of confusion for people new to OCaml is the fact that variables are immutable. This seems pretty surprising even on linguistic terms. Isn’t the whole point of a variable that it can vary? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to this is that variables in OCaml (and generally in functional languages) are really more like variables in an equation than a variable in an imperative language. If you think about the mathematical identity **x(y + z) = xy + xz**, there’s no notion of mutating the variables **x**, **y**, and **z**. They vary in the sense that you can instantiate this equation with different numbers for those variables, and it still holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true in a functional language. A function can be applied to different inputs, and thus its variables will take on different values, even without mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pattern Matching and let\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful feature of **let** bindings is that they support the use of patterns on the left-hand side. Consider the following code, which uses **List.unzip**, a function for converting a list of pairs into a pair of lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let (ints,strings) = List.unzip [(1,\"one\"); (2,\"two\"); (3,\"three\")];;\n",
    "val ints : int list = [1; 2; 3]\n",
    "val strings : string list = [\"one\"; \"two\"; \"three\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, **(ints,strings)** is a pattern, and the **let** binding assigns values to both of the identifiers that show up in that pattern. A pattern is essentially a description of the shape of a data structure, where some components are names to be bound to values. As we saw in Chapter 1, Tuples Lists Options And Pattern Matching, OCaml has patterns for a variety of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a pattern in a **let** binding makes the most sense for a pattern that is irrefutable, i.e., where any value of the type in question is guaranteed to match the pattern. Tuple and record patterns are irrefutable, but list patterns are not. Consider the following code that implements a function for upper casing the first element of a comma-separated list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let upcase_first_entry line =\n",
    "  let (first :: rest) = String.split ~on:',' line in\n",
    "  String.concat ~sep:\",\" (String.uppercase first :: rest)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "Characters 34-144:\n",
    "Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.\n",
    "Here is an example of a case that is not matched:\n",
    "[]\n",
    "val upcase_first_entry : string -> string = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This case can’t really come up in practice, because **String.split** always returns a list with at least one element, even when given the empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "upcase_first_entry \"one,two,three\";;\n",
    "- : string = \"ONE,two,three\"\n",
    "upcase_first_entry \"\";;\n",
    "- : string = \"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the compiler doesn’t know this, and so it emits the warning. It’s generally better to use a **match** statement to handle such cases explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let upcase_first_entry line =\n",
    "  match String.split ~on:',' line with\n",
    "  | [] -> assert false (* String.split returns at least one element *)\n",
    "  | first :: rest -> String.concat ~sep:\",\" (String.uppercase first :: rest)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val upcase_first_entry : string -> string = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is our first use of **assert**, which is useful for marking cases that should be impossible. We’ll discuss **assert** in more detail in Chapter 7, Error Handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that OCaml is a functional language, it’s no surprise that functions are important and pervasive. Indeed, functions have come up in almost every example we’ve done so far. This section will go into more depth, explaining the details of how OCaml’s functions work. As you’ll see, functions in OCaml differ in a variety of ways from what you’ll find in most mainstream languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anonymous Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll start by looking at the most basic style of function declaration in OCaml: the anonymous function. An anonymous function is a function that is declared without being named. These can be declared using the **fun** keyword, as shown here. \n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "(fun x -> x + 1);;\n",
    "- : int -> int = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Anonymous functions operate in much the same way as named functions. For example, we can apply an anonymous function to an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "(fun x -> x + 1) 7;;\n",
    "- : int = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or pass it to another function. Passing functions to iteration functions like **List.map** is probably the most common use case for anonymous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "List.map ~f:(fun x -> x + 1) [1;2;3];;\n",
    "- : int list = [2; 3; 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even stuff a function into a data structure, like a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let transforms = [ String.uppercase; String.lowercase ];;\n",
    "val transforms : (string -> string) list = [; ]\n",
    "List.map ~f:(fun g -> g \"Hello World\") transforms;;\n",
    "- : string list = [\"HELLO WORLD\"; \"hello world\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s worth stopping for a moment to puzzle this example out, since this kind of higher-order use of functions can be a bit obscure at first. Notice that **(fun g -> g \"Hello World\")** is a function that takes a function as an argument, and then applies that function to the string **\"Hello World\"**. The invocation of **List.map** applies **(fun g -> g \"Hello World\")** to the elements of **transforms**, which are themselves functions. The returned list containing the results of these function applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to understand is that functions are ordinary values in OCaml, and you can do everything with them that you’d do with an ordinary value, including passing them to and returning them from other functions and storing them in data structures. We even name functions in the same way that we name other values, by using a **let** binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let plusone = (fun x -> x + 1);;\n",
    "val plusone : int -> int = \n",
    "plusone 3;;\n",
    "- : int = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining named functions is so common that there is some syntactic sugar for it. Thus, the following definition of **plusone** is equivalent to the previous definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let plusone x = x + 1;;\n",
    "val plusone : int -> int = \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common and convenient way to declare a function, but syntactic niceties aside, the two styles of function definition are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "### LET AND FUN\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions and **let** bindings have a lot to do with each other. In some sense, you can think of the parameter of a function as a variable being bound to the value passed by the caller. Indeed, the following two expressions are nearly equivalent. \n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "(fun x -> x + 1) 7;;\n",
    "- : int = 8\n",
    "let x = 7 in x + 1;;\n",
    "- : int = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This connection is important, and will come up more when programming in a monadic style, as we’ll see in Chapter 18, Concurrent Programming With Async.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiargument functions\n",
    "\n",
    "OCaml of course also supports multiargument functions, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let abs_diff x y = abs (x - y);;\n",
    "val abs_diff : int -> int -> int = \n",
    "abs_diff 3 4;;\n",
    "- : int = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find the type signature of **abs_diff** with all of its arrows a little hard to parse. To understand what’s going on, let’s rewrite **abs_diff** in an equivalent form, using the **fun** keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let abs_diff =\n",
    "(fun x -> (fun y -> abs (x - y)))\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val abs_diff : int -> int -> int =\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This rewrite makes it explicit that **abs_diff** is actually a function of one argument that returns another function of one argument, which itself returns the final result. Because the functions are nested, the inner expression **abs (x - y)** has access to both **x**, which was bound by the outer function application, and **y**, which was bound by the inner one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This style of function is called a curried function. (Currying is named after Haskell Curry, a logician who had a significant impact on the design and theory of programming languages.) The key to interpreting the type signature of a curried function is the observation that **->** is right-associative. The type signature of **abs_diff** can therefore be parenthesized as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "val abs_diff : int -> (int -> int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The parentheses don’t change the meaning of the signature, but they make it easier to see the currying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currying is more than just a theoretical curiosity. You can make use of currying to specialize a function by feeding in some of the arguments. Here’s an example where we create a specialized version of **abs_diff** that measures the distance of a given number from **3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let dist_from_3 = abs_diff 3;;\n",
    "val dist_from_3 : int -> int = \n",
    "dist_from_3 8;;\n",
    "- : int = 5\n",
    "dist_from_3 (-1);;\n",
    "- : int = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The practice of applying some of the arguments of a curried function to get a new function is called partial application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the **fun** keyword supports its own syntax for currying, so the following definition of **abs_diff** is equivalent to the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let abs_diff = (fun x y -> abs (x - y));;\n",
    "val abs_diff : int -> int -> int =\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might worry that curried functions are terribly expensive, but this is not the case. In OCaml, there is no penalty for calling a curried function with all of its arguments. (Partial application, unsurprisingly, does have a small extra cost.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Currying is not the only way of writing a multiargument function in OCaml. It’s also possible to use the different parts of a tuple as different arguments. So, we could write.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let abs_diff (x,y) = abs (x - y);;\n",
    "val abs_diff : int * int -> int = \n",
    "abs_diff (3,4);;\n",
    "- : int = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OCaml handles this calling convention efficiently as well. In particular it does not generally have to allocate a tuple just for the purpose of sending arguments to a tuple-style function. You can’t, however, use partial application for this style of function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are small trade-offs between these two approaches, but most of the time, one should stick to currying, since it’s the default style in the OCaml world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursive Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is recursive if it refers to itself in its definition. Recursion is important in any programming language, but is particularly important in functional languages, because it is the way that you build looping constructs. (As will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, Imperative Programming 1, OCaml also supports imperative looping constructs like **for** and **while**, but these are only useful when using OCaml’s imperative features.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define a recursive function, you need to mark the **let** binding as recursive with the **rec** keyword, as shown in this function for finding the first sequentially repeated element in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let rec find_first_repeat list =\n",
    "  match list with\n",
    "  | [] | [_] ->\n",
    "    (* only zero or one elements, so no repeats *)\n",
    "    None\n",
    "  | x :: y :: tl ->\n",
    "    if x = y then Some x else find_first_repeat (y::tl)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val find_first_repeat : int list -> int option =\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern **\\[\\]** | **\\[_\\]** is itself a disjunction of multiple patterns, otherwise known as an or-pattern. An or-pattern matches if any of the sub-patterns match. In this case, **\\[\\]** matches the empty list, and **\\[_\\]** matches any single element list. The **_** is there so we don’t have to put an explicit name on that single element. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define multiple mutually recursive values by using **let** **rec** combined with the **and** keyword. Here’s a (gratuitously inefficient) example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let rec is_even x =\n",
    "  if x = 0 then true else is_odd (x - 1)\n",
    "and is_odd x =\n",
    "  if x = 0 then false else is_even (x - 1)\n",
    ";;\n",
    "val is_even : int -> bool = \n",
    "val is_odd : int -> bool = \n",
    "List.map ~f:is_even [0;1;2;3;4;5];;\n",
    "- : bool list = [true; false; true; false; true; false]\n",
    "List.map ~f:is_odd [0;1;2;3;4;5];;\n",
    "- : bool list = [false; true; false; true; false; true]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OCaml distinguishes between nonrecursive definitions (using **let**) and recursive definitions (using **let rec**) largely for technical reasons: the type-inference algorithm needs to know when a set of function definitions are mutually recursive, and these have to be marked explicitly by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this decision has some good effects. For one thing, recursive (and especially mutually recursive) definitions are harder to reason about than nonrecursive ones. It’s therefore useful that, in the absence of an explicit **rec**, you can assume that a **let** binding is nonrecursive, and so can only build upon previous definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, having a nonrecursive form makes it easier to create a new definition that extends and supersedes an existing one by shadowing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prefix and Infix Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve seen examples of functions used in both prefix and infix style.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "Int.max 3 4  (* prefix *);;\n",
    "- : int = 4\n",
    "3 + 4        (* infix  *);;\n",
    "- : int = 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not have thought of the second example as an ordinary function, but it very much is. Infix operators like **+** really only differ syntactically from other functions. In fact, if we put parentheses around an infix operator, you can use it as an ordinary prefix function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "(+) 3 4;;\n",
    "- : int = 7\n",
    "List.map ~f:((+) 3) [4;5;6];;\n",
    "- : int list = [7; 8; 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second expression, we’ve partially applied **(+)** to create a function that increments its single argument by **3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is treated syntactically as an operator if the name of that function is chosen from one of a specialized set of identifiers. This set includes identifiers that are sequences of characters from the following set:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @ ^ | ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**or** is one of a handful of predetermined strings, including **mod**, the modulus operator, and **lsl**, for “logical shift left,” a bit-shifting operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define (or redefine) the meaning of an operator. Here’s an example of a simple vector-addition operator on **int** pairs.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Up until now, the functions we’ve defined have specified their arguments positionally, i.e., by the order in which the arguments are passed to the function. OCaml also supports labeled arguments, which let you identify a function argument by name. Indeed, we’ve already encountered functions from **Base** like **List.map** that use labeled arguments.

    "- When defining a function with lots of arguments. Beyond a certain number, arguments are easier to remember by name than by position.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the meaning of a particular argument is unclear from the type alone. Consider a function for creating a hash table whose first argument is the initial size of the array backing the hash table, and the second is a Boolean flag, which indicates whether that array will ever shrink when elements are removed.\n",

    "  init_size:int -> allow_shrinking:bool -> ('a,'b) Hashtable.t\n",

    "val substring: string -> int -> int -> string\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "- When you want flexibility on the order in which arguments are passed. Consider a function like **List.iter**, which takes two arguments. a function and a list of elements to call that function on.

    "- : string = \"foo:bar\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, **?** is used in the definition of the function to mark **sep** as optional. And while the caller can pass a value of type **string** for **sep**, internally to the function, **sep** is seen as a **string option**, with **None** appearing when **sep** is not provided by the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding example needed a bit of boilerplate to choose a default separator when none was provided. This is a common enough pattern that there’s an explicit syntax for providing a default value, which allows us to write **concat** more concisely.\n",

    "Optional arguments are very useful, but they’re also easy to abuse. The key advantage of optional arguments is that they let you write functions with multiple arguments that users can ignore most of the time, only worrying about them when they specifically want to invoke those options. They also allow you to extend an API with new functionality without changing existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside is that the caller may be unaware that there is a choice to be made, and so may unknowingly (and wrongly) pick the default behavior. Optional arguments really only make sense when the extra concision of omitting the argument outweighs the corresponding loss of explicitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that rarely used functions should not have optional arguments. A good rule of thumb is to avoid optional arguments for functions internal to a module, i.e., functions that are not included in the module’s interface, or **mli** file. We’ll learn more about **mlis** in Chapter 4, Files Modules And Programs.\n",

    "### EXPLICIT PASSING OF AN OPTIONAL ARGUMENT\n",

    "\n",
    "But sometimes, passing in **Some** or **None** explicitly is exactly what you want. OCaml lets you do this by using ? instead of ~ to mark the argument. Thus, the following two lines are equivalent ways of specifying the **sep** argument to **concat**.\n",

    "- : string = \"foobar\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One use case for this is when you want to define a wrapper function that mimics the optional arguments of the function it’s wrapping. For example, imagine we wanted to create a function called **uppercase_concat**, which is the same as **concat** except that it converts the first string that it’s passed to uppercase. We could write the function as follows.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "Instead, we can have **uppercase_concat** simply pass through the optional argument to **concat** using the **?** syntax.\n",

Consider the following example for computing numerical derivatives of a function of two real variables. The function takes an argument **delta**, which determines the scale at which to compute the derivative; values **x** and **y**, which determine at which point to compute the derivative; and the function **f**, whose derivative is being computed. The function **f** itself takes two labeled arguments, **x** and **y**. Note that you can use an apostrophe as part of a variable name, so **x'** and **y'** are just ordinary variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "So when does OCaml decide to erase an optional argument?\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule is: an optional argument is erased as soon as the first positional (i.e., neither labeled nor optional) argument defined after the optional argument is passed in. That explains the behavior of **prepend_pound**. But if we had instead defined **concat** with the optional argument in the second position.\n",
